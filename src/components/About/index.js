      Previously, I worked in costume design where I discovered a love for visual storytelling. Now, storytelling is what inspires my product design. In my work, I strive to find balance between form and function, focusing on detail while never letting the broader picture out of sight. I find joy in making things both beautiful and accessible. Iâ€™m optimistic, curious and excited to further develop my skills. I love working with others, sharing ideas, and learning from those around me.        </p>
